**Project SOOPERCHARGE** is the first comprehensive Reverse Engineering and Modification project for the **LOOI Robot**.
This repository hosts documentation, decompiled logic analysis, packet captures, and more.

This README has been co-writed with the help of AI. All content being read here has then been reviewed multiple times by an human (me). I ain't got hours to write, please bear with me.

## About the app.

The stock LOOI application locks several features behind server-side configurations and hardware sensors. Through targeted Smali code manipulation, I have successfully bypassed some of these limits.

### Unlocking Incomplete Games (LOOI Pong)

The app resources contain a fully functional activity `LooiPingPongActivity` (Pong), but it is hidden from the main menu's `GameCenterActivity`. Consider this game is broken and incomplete, and is literally just 2 player pong. Probably scrapped due to the (apparently) low performance 2 face recognition system.

**The Mod:**

* **Target:** `com.TangibleFuture.looiRobot.game.activity.GameCenterActivity`.
* **Menu Injection:** I increased the `GameBean` array size in `initData` from 3 to 4 and injected a new game item.
* **Logic:** The launch function `jumpGame` contains a check for a specific localized string. I hardcoded the menu item name to **"LOOI Pong"** (as there are some weird function limits I'm not confident with yet) and patched `jumpGame` to accept this string as the "password" to launch the hidden activity.

### RC Unleashed

The stock application artificially restricts Remote Control usage by monitoring the `phone_stick_state` variable (containing the magnetic attachment state). If the phone is detected as "Docked" on the robot, the app blocks the RC interface with a mandatory "Take Down Phone" dialog, forcing you to decapitate the poor thing. Hell, what if you want to drive it with cardboard LOOI on?

**The Mod:**

* **Target:** `com.TangibleFuture.looiRobot.activity.RemoteControlActivity`.
* **Logic Bypass:** I identified the sensor check routine within the `onResume` lifecycle method and removed the conditional jump that triggers the blocking dialog. Additionally, the `showTakeDownPhoneDialog` method was neutralized to prevent any asynchronous triggers.
* **Result:** The RC interface now loads immediately regardless of the phone's physical position, enabling fully functional driving controls while something is mounted on the robot.

### About LLM REing

It is definitely possible to reimplement your own LLM model in it, I've found multiple API keys that I won't be sharing for obvious reasons. I've tried changing the system prompt multiple times and failed, it seems like it may be actively fetching it from the backend. I'm still working on it and will share progress as soon as I have some.

## 📡 About LOOI's BLE protocol

LOOI operates on a sequence-based BLE protocol. It is not a simple direct-drive remote control; it uses a "Script Mode" logic where commands act as frames in an animation sequence.

### Connection Handshake

Unfortunately, you cannot simply connect via NRF Connect and start sending commands immediately. The robot requires a handshake sequence initiated by the official app - I have found it in the app's source code, but haven't actually analyzed it yet. If this handshake is missing, LOOI will disconnect after a few seconds.

Connect via the official app first, background it (do not kill it), then connect from NRF connect. :-)

### The Command Interface (`fe00`)

The primary write characteristic is `fe00`. It accepts multi-byte strings to coordinate motors, LEDs, and screen animations.
The command structure is GENERALLY a **17-byte packet**.

**Reference Command (Rotate and turn led red - it's a custom command, you're welcome to try it):**
`00 07 00 FF 05 00 00 00 00 64 02 0A 96 02 14 00 02`

**Packet Breakdown:**

| Byte Index | Value (Hex) | Field Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | `00` | **SEQ** | Rolling Sequence Counter (00-FF). Must increment or packet is dropped. |
| **1** | `07` | **OPCODE** | The Command Type, I still have to figure it out |
| **2** | `00` | **SUB_OP** | Sub-command or mode modifier. |
| **3** | `FF` | **MASK_A** | Target System Mask A. |
| **4** | `05` | **MASK_B** | Target System Mask B. |
| **5-8** | `00..00` | **PAYLOAD** | 4-Byte Data Block. |
| **9** | `64` | **VALUE** | Magnitude/Speed. `64` (Hex) = 100 (Decimal). |
| **10** | `02` | **PARAM_1** | Auxiliary Parameter 1. |
| **11** | `0A` | **PARAM_2** | Auxiliary Parameter 2. |
| **12** | `96` | **DURATION** | Execution time in ticks/ms (`96` = 150). |
| **13** | `02` | **PARAM_3** | Context specific. |
| **14** | `14` | **PARAM_4** | Context specific. |
| **15** | `00` | **RES** | Reserved. |
| **16** | `02` | **END/CRC** | Footer or Checksum. |

### Known Characteristics & UUIDs (Incomplete, I'll add the rest soon I promise)

| UUID Prefix | Function | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **fe00** | **Command Interface** | Main write channel for animations and movement. |
| **ff02** | **Motor Drive (Boost)** | High-speed movement. Sending `FF` supposedly changes direction. |
| **fed0** | **Motor Drive (Slow)** | Precision movement control. |
| **fed1** | **Neck Motor** | Independent head articulation. |
| **fed2** | **Headlight/Torch** | Direct control: `00` = Off, `03` = On. |
| **fed9** | **Sensor Data** | Read-only stream (Cliff sensors, TOF distance, Battery). |
